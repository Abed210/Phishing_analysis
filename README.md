# Phishing Analysis Reports
This is a phishing analysis project with real world samples to test my Phishing analysis skills.

All URLs have been defanged to prevent them from being clickable since most of these links are malicious.
You can fang the URLs with CyberChef ("gchq.github.io/CyberChef")

Please feel free to critic or notify me on what I could do better.
I will be adding more samples from time to time.
